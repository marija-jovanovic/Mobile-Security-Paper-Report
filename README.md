Exploring TLS Certificate Verification in Mobile Applications.

Nowadays most mobile applications make use of
Internet services to perform their functionalities. As such, establishing secure connections with the help of Transport Layer Security (TLS) is crucial, but not sufficient. The implementation of proper certificate validation logic is just as important and it is performed at the client side. Writing custom code, especially for implementing important security features such as certificate validation is usually not recommended, as it has been proven to be error-prone leading to open vulnerabilities. As a result, companies shift towards less code-writing solutions. For example, Google introduced Network Security Configuration (NSC), an Extensible Markup Language (XML) configuration file that only requires configuring security parameters, instead of writing full code from scratch. Apple introduced the App Transport Security (ATS) which allows for similar network related configurations. While these solutions sound ideal on paper, we explore how they work in reality and the behavior of developers towards them. Additionally, Google implemented safeguards, which scan the applications before being published to find potential insecurities, including insecure certificate validation logic. We also show that these safeguards are not as efficient as expected and there is more room for improvement in this area.
